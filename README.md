## 🆕 Introduction

Becoming a web developer today can be a hard journey. Online there are tons of videos, books, and courses. This can cause analysis paralysis. Also, as a new developer, you can literally learn tens of different languages. There are a few reasons why I decided to create this repository:

- Let you avoid common mistakes
- Provide a  study path accessible to everyone
- Connect the dots between the technologies
- Help you learn tech in the correct way

## 🧠 Assumptions

Unfortunately, in computer science, there is no solution that fits all the requirements. I have to make a few assumptions about you to give you a useful path.

My assumptions are: 

- You are passionate about computer science and you want to learn more
- Your English level is enough to understand videos, books, and articles
- You don’t have past working experience in this field
- All the listed resources are 
- You have basics tech skills, like using a computer, installing software, and using the web

## ⚠️ Warning and useful link
This 15-week web developer roadmap is designed to give you a taste of what it's like to be a developer and help you understand if this is the career path you'd like to pursue. It's important to remember that this roadmap is a starting point, aimed at helping you with prototyping and gaining some practical knowledge.

While this roadmap provides a wealth of useful information for , it's crucial to keep in mind that it is not a replacement for a more formal education, such as a university degree. A comprehensive education will provide you with in-depth knowledge and a strong foundation in computer science, which is essential for a successful career in web development.

So, if you're a tech enthusiast considering a developer career, give this 15-week roadmap a try to see if it's the right fit for you. But remember, this is only the beginning of your journey, and further education will be necessary to fully develop your skills and knowledge in the field.

You can check a few useful resources about CS:

- [Developer Roadmaps](https://roadmap.sh/roadmaps)

## 📚 How to use this guide

As you’ll see in the next section, I divided the study into multiple weeks. I assume a daily study of 5h/day, 6 days/week (30hrs/week). If you can’t afford this rhythm (which is totally fine), just keep in mind that this is not a race, you can take your time.

You’ll find a few checkboxes, feel  to copy this document (or fork it as we will see later) and check the checkbox as soon as you finish an activity. 

You’ll find activities related to hard and soft skills. Being a good developer is not about writing code. 

Ready? Let’s get started! 🚀

## 🆙  Getting Help

As you embark on your journey through the Web Developer Roadmap, you may encounter challenges or have questions along the way. Don't worry - this is a normal part of the learning process. If you have any doubts, our ACM webdev team is ready to help you out. Feel free to reach us out on community groups.

### 🎨 Week 2 - HTML & CSS Basic

#### Week description

HTML & CSS are two of the 3 main components of a frontend web application. 

Like other topics in this roadmap, is virtually impossible to learn them in one week, but we can at least gain a basic understanding of how they work and start experimenting to create a few demo applications. We will cover the HTML & CSS basics, Tailwind and we’re going to create a first presentation Linkedin post.

#### Why it matters

HTML creates the basic structure of a web page. With CSS we can add style, animations, handling responsiveness, and a lot more. Also, joining dev communities is really important and can be a career booster.

Right now you should have an understanding of how the DOM works, how to style HTML, and you should already have a few projects on Github, congratulations! 🎉

Keep in mind that this is not programming. HTML and CSS are a way to define what to show on a web browser. Programming is something different, we will see it in the next week.

### 🔥 Week 4 - JS Intermediate

#### Week Description
During the fourth week of our 15-week web developer roadmap, you'll be focusing on gaining a deep understanding of JavaScript and clean coding practices. You will study the renowned book "Eloquent JavaScript" up to Chapter 19, taking notes and reproducing all the projects from the chapters. Additionally, you'll create a Github repository to store your notes and share them with others. To further enhance your coding skills, you'll watch a "Clean Code" playlist to learn best practices for writing efficient and maintainable code. Finally, you'll engage with the community by participating in an online JavaScript event or workshop, sharing your experience on LinkedIn, and inviting others to contribute to your Github repository via Pull Requests.

#### Why It Matters
JavaScript is an essential language for web development, and having a solid grasp of its fundamentals will enable you to build interactive and dynamic websites. Studying "Eloquent JavaScript" will help you understand the language's core concepts, techniques, and best practices, making you a more skilled and effective web developer. Learning clean coding practices through the "Clean Code" playlist will allow you to write code that is not only efficient but also maintainable, a valuable skill for any developer.

### 🌐 Week 7 - NodeJs + Express + REST

#### Week Description

This week, you will focus on mastering Node.js and Express.js, learning about API testing with Postman, and studying best practices for REST API design. Begin by studying the Node.js and Express.js full course, followed by chapters 20-21 of Eloquent JavaScript. Next, explore API testing by studying the Postman Beginner's Course. After that, read an article about REST API best practices to deepen your understanding of API design.

Once you have a strong foundation in these areas, implement a basic CRUD REST API to practice your skills. Learn how to use Node.js with TypeScript to enhance your projects with type safety and other TypeScript features. To assess your progress, check your knowledge using the Node.js roadmap. Finally, aim to complete three mentoring sessions by reaching out to more experienced developers on LinkedIn for guidance and advice.

#### Why it Matters

Node.js and Express.js are essential tools in modern web development, enabling developers to create fast and efficient server-side applications. Learning about these technologies and mastering API testing with Postman will provide you with a competitive edge in the job market.

Studying best practices for REST API design and implementing a CRUD REST API will help you create robust and maintainable APIs for your projects, improving the overall quality of your applications. Integrating TypeScript with Node.js will enhance your projects with better type checking and other TypeScript features, leading to more reliable and scalable code.

### ⛓️ Week 8 - Database Basics
#### Week Description

This week, you will explore various database paradigms and learn how to work with SQL and NoSQL databases using popular tools and frameworks. Start by understanding the different types of database systems and their use cases. Next, learn the fundamentals of SQL and relational databases, covering topics such as database design, querying, and administration.

After gaining a solid understanding of SQL, dive into TypeORM, a powerful Object Relational Mapper (ORM) for TypeScript and JavaScript, which will equip you with the skills to work with databases in a Node.js environment. Lastly, learn how to build applications using MongoDB, a popular NoSQL database, in conjunction with Node.js, Express, and Mongoose, covering essential concepts such as schema design, data modeling, and CRUD operations.

#### Why it Matters

Databases play a critical role in the storage and management of data for various software systems. Understanding different database paradigms and being proficient in working with both SQL and NoSQL databases are essential skills for developers.

Gaining valuable knowledge about various database paradigms will help you make informed decisions when selecting the appropriate database technology for your projects. Learning SQL and relational databases will enable you to work with widely-used database systems, while familiarity with TypeORM will allow you to work efficiently with databases in a Node.js environment. Acquiring skills in MongoDB will provide you with the ability to handle large-scale and complex data in NoSQL databases. These skills will make you a more versatile developer and increase your employability and value in the job market.
